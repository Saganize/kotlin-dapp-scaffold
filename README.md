# Kotlin dApp Scaffold
This is a repository template providing a fast and efficient way for developers to build decentralized Mobile applications on the Solana Blockchain. The Scaffold includes pre-built components integrated with features, such as Wallet connection, Airdrop SOL, and Sign and Send transactions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

To start using Scaffold, follow the below steps:
1. **Use Repository**:
- Click on "Use this template" dropdown.
- Select "Create a new repository".
- Clone the repository to your local device using `git clone <repository-url>` command.
2. **Obtain Your API Key**: 
- Visit our Dashboard to acquire your unique API_KEY. Not sure how to get started? Follow our [guide](https://docs.saganize.com/get-started/dashboard) for step-by-step instructions on obtaining your API key. 
- Replace this `YOUR_API_KEY` in `App.kt` file, [here](https://github.com/Saganize/kotlin-dapp-scaffold/blob/890646d39654f5e27238e6327ff420206788c87b/sample/src/main/java/com/saganize/solwave/sample/App.kt#L52)
3. **Firebase Configuration**: 
- Get the Firebase configuration file for your project. This step is crucial for enabling advanced features and functionalities within the Solwave SDK. For assistance, [follow the steps mentioned and get and download the Firebase Configuration file](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup#console). 
- Also, it is important to enable [Firebase Authentication for Google Sign In](https://firebaseopensource.com/projects/firebase/quickstart-android/auth/readme/) and re-import the `google-services.json` file.

You can now run the app and test out the Mobile Scaffold.
